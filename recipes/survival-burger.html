        <h3>Not everything with a bun is a burger, or appetizing</h3>

        <p>Stardew Valley describes this dish as follows:</p>
        <p>"A convenient snack for the explorer."</p>
        <p>Personally, I need to know what a cave carrot is before I order one of these</p>

        <h3>Ingredients</h3>

        <ul>
            <li>Bread</li>
            <li>Eggplant</li>
            <li>Cave Carrot</li>
        </ul>

        <p><i>Seriously, what is this thing??</i></p>

        <h3>Steps</h3>

        <ol>
            <li>Have Robin build the first house expansion for you<br>
                <i>
                    You may need this to create ingredients and definitely to create the dish<br>
                    Since it takes 3 days for her to finish it, you should start here
                </i>
            </li>
            <li>Acquire ingredients:
                <ul>
                    <li>Bread can be bought at the saloon or made from wheat flour in your kitchen</li>
                    <li>Eggplants must be grown in fall, though you might get one off the travelling merchant at a steep price</li>
                    <li>Cave carrots can be found in caves <i>(as you might expect)</i></li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li>Whip up as many of these as you want in your brand new kitchen!</li>
        </ol>

        <p><i>Are you sure you really want a hairy carrot burger?</i></p>
