        <h3>An interesting donut spinoff that fortunately never made it to the general public</h3>

        <p>
            Almost everyone appreciates donuts, a little coffee makes a great side drink.<br>
            Donuts filled with coffee flavored filling doesn't sound bad at all!<br>
            Unfortunately, thats not what Slocum's BuzzBites are. They are filled with actual hot coffee<br>
            Obviously, these led to 3rd degree burns during prototype testing and were thus deemed unsafe.
        </p>

        <h3>Ingredients</h3>

        <ul>
            <li>Dirty Water</li><em>&nbsp;Probably a post-war substitute<br>
                                    &nbsp;Hopefully...</em>
            <li>Mirelurk Eggs</li><em>&nbsp;Believe it or not, Mirelurk were bred before the war</em>
            <li>Oil</li><em>&nbsp;I'm sure originally they meant vegetable<br>
                            &nbsp;Post-war though? Any kind will work</em>
            <li>Razorgrain</li><em>&nbsp;Definite post-war substitute, courtesy of the Brotherhood of Steel</em>
            <li>Coffee Tin</li><em>&nbsp;I am sure this is for the coffee, not the tin</em>
        </ul>

        <p>
            Like many other creations of the Fallout Universe, this recipe excels at showing both the<br>
            frivolous treatment of safety of the pre-war corporate culture and the post-war creativity<br>
            and resilience in the face of extreme scarcity.
        </p>
