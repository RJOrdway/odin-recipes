        <h1>Apple Cabbage Stew</h1>
        <h2><em>Skyrim</em></h2>

        <img src="Apple_Cabbage_Stew.webp" alt="Apple Cabbage Stew from Skyrim" style="width: 480px;height:360px;">

        <h3>A normal sounding dish with an unpalatable twist</h3>

        <p>
            The sweetness and acidity of apples, a hearty and nutritious foundation of cabbage.<br>
            Absolutely ruined with a heart attack inducing quantity of salt.
        </p>

        <h3>Ingredients</h3>

        <ul>
            <li>Cabbage</li><em>&nbsp;Ok, normal so far</em>
            <li>Red Apple</li><em>&nbsp;Sounds great</em>
            <li>Salt Pile</li><em>&nbsp;I'm sorry, salt <u>pile</u>???</em>
        </ul>

        <p>
            It's important to note that the <i>Salt Pile</i> item appears to be a half full bowl of salt.<br>
            Sources vary in how much salt it takes to kill the average person, but given the <br>
            0.2 <em>(units? Kg?)</em> item weight, I estimate this soup could kill 2-3 adult humans.  
        </p>

        <h3>Steps</h3>

        <ol>
            <li>Acquire ingredients:
                <ul>
                    <li>Cabbages can be harvested or purchased from many merchants <em>or stolen from them</em></li>
                    <li>Red Apples cannot be harvested from apple trees, don't bother, find them scattered around or check with merchants</li>
                    <li>Salt pile can be found in random barrels and with merchants that sell food or alchemical supplies</li>
                </ul>
            </li>

            <li>Find a <i>cooking spit</i> or a <i>cooking pot</i></li>
            <li>Interact with cooking spit or pot and select the desired recipe</li>
        </ol>
